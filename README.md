# Memories Project

This project was created by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aibtHnbeuio&t=7s).

## What is this Project?

This project is a website that allows users to create memories with a title, message, tag(s), and an image. Each memory can be updated/deleted and also liked.

## How was this project created?

This project was created using the MERN Stack, MongoDB was used to store the posts for each memory, Express for the backend to manage/create the posts, React for the front-end to display the posts.

## Next steps

The next steps would be to add authentication/users to the website so we can limit the number of likes on the posts.
